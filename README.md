# comp_scrawler
Comp Scrawler is a marketing web crawler that spiders and automates normally manual tasks on websites.
The code is open sourced for educational purposes. The use of this script is at your own risk and liability.

Partially based on the [Scrappy Airbnb tutorial](http://www.verginer.eu/blog/web-scraping-airbnb/) and my own selenium scripting.

Any companies on the targeted list that wish to contact me can do so at contactus@tourzan.com with the subject "comp_scrawler target <company name>" I am willing to discuss opportunities of partnerships, job offers, information redaction, etc.
